### After formatting is applied

![**After formatting** is applied](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2598/1*dxRICzA7RWva8lEcnMk12w.png)

The language used is **Kotlin** but the concepts will remain same so don’t worry if you don’t know Kotlin

What it does:
1. It will reformat your GQL query that is stored in some variable (The idea is very similar to JSON Formatter)
2. You can then replace this formatted GQL query into that variable

What do we need to do to build this
1. We will need a UI where we will see our formatted code
2. We need to read the code from the file
3. We need to write th formatted code back to the file and override the variable’s value

Concepts that will be used:
1. Editor
2. Tool windows (Swing GUI)
3. File Reading/Writing via PsiElementVisitor
4. Creating PsiElement (String template)

Why do we need it:
To keep our GQL query code consistent across our project and it is also readable now

We have to cover these parts:
1. Setup basic project to develop plugin
2. Create UI where we will see our formatted Code
3. Format GQL query with our code
4. Paste the code back to the source code from your tool window
5. Few things about publishing plugin

## 1. Setup Basic Project

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*n7IbaTABjbCXulm2GQVlgA.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BBsAu7DV75xlBGAPVQ5H5w.png)

Click on the **finish**. Beware this project will download at least ***500mb*** of data for every time you will create an IntelliJ Platform Plugin. Actually it will download IntelliJ SDK.

But we can avoid that and use from local *(This is totally optional)*

Original(default) build.gradle

    plugins **{
        **id 'java'
        id 'org.jetbrains.intellij' version '0.4.21'
    **}
    
    **group 'org.example'
    version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
    
    repositories **{
        **mavenCentral()
    **}
    
    **dependencies **{
        **testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
    **}
    **
    intellij **{
        **version '2020.1.1' // this is reason for 500mb download
    **}
    ...**

Now we need to pass local path of IntelliJ like below:

    intellij **{
        **localPath "/home/rahulkumarlohra-xps/IdeaProjects/ideaIC-2020.1"
    **}**

    //If you get some errors like annotations not found then make them available like this
    dependencies **{
        **compile group: 'org.jetbrains', name: 'annotations', version: '19.0.0'
    **}**

Like to build.gradle: [https://github.com/rahul-lohra/gql-formatter-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle](https://github.com/rahul-lohra/gql-formatter-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle)

Let’s see one more file which is auto-created: ***plugin.xml***

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/a3003a323d5dafde19a510ec31b96a53" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You might get some error initially, it is basically like a warning that you should enter the values for name,description,vendor details
Few tips:
id: Should be your package name and should be unique 
description: You can use **HTML** tags here

## 2. Create UI where we will see our formatted Code

This is what we will create

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*poxsoQx4wW4BKU2QxRKEwQ.png)

Functionalities of this tool:
**1. Import:** It will get the value stored in the variable which is provided in this white box
**2. Replace:** It will set back the formatted value to the original source code file

This is how it will look once we have filled some values on it

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3838/1*u4zyTtN8vR101wHggAeXfg.png)
&gt; **(Optional)**We are going to create a **Swing GUI**. If you are new to Swing GUI then watch this video to understand how to create Swing GUI : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vSyylPPEko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vSyylPPEko)

### Follow these steps to create the UI

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fKB3EeqE87GZx6kxDGNquQ.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*o8kf0x7yNmxS_CquO0r6_A.png)

After tapping on **OK : Two files **will be created for and those are:**
1. GqlView.java
2. GqlView.form**

### GqlView.java

This file will contain all the UI elements as member variables and you can add listeners to these views

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e691acd58eb9528705ffac173d605ace" frameborder="0"></iframe>

All the member variables are auto-generated and they automatically linked with their respective UIs

**GqlView.form
**This is actually an XML file that contains all the Swing UI elements and also how each one they are relatively placed(positioned) 
The IDE generally do not allow us to directly edit this XML file. It has its own drag and drop user interface to create the UI. In the below picture, you can see the 
1. Palette window to the extreme right.
2. Component Tree
3. Actual UI

This is how the GqlView.form should look **initially**, right after it is created

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*j4krKSPrlt_58qJNoTDpyw.png)

Use this ***Two code snippets*** to **create the final UI**
1. [https://github.com/rahul-lohra/gql-formatter-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rahul/gqlformat/GqlView.form](https://github.com/rahul-lohra/gql-formatter-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rahul/gqlformat/GqlView.form)

After copy-pasting the content we should see UI like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2752/1*dGUAE9G5qnvuC0yEozbUYg.png)

2. Since we have manually edited the GqlView.form so that’s why we also need to manually edit the GqlView

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e691acd58eb9528705ffac173d605ace" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The UI should be ready now

### Add this UI to a Tool Window

Things to do
1. Create a class that will be registered as Tool Window (creation + registration)
2. That class should also render the UI that we just created (Connect that class to our UI class)

### Create Toolwindow

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/d3ca73333d63fa0e278db6973b656f9c" frameborder="0"></iframe>

We have 2 things
1. Implement ToolWindowFactory: this class will be registered later
2. override createToolWindowContent : In this method, we are just attaching the UI to this Toolwindow

Register the Toolwindow like below on ***plugin.xml***

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/c59102f5aedcbc3b1786d832dd8c921e" frameborder="0"></iframe>

id: It will be the name displayed over your toolwindow
anchor: Position where the toolwindow will be displayed
factoryClass: Points to our newly created ToolWindowclass

## 3. Format GQL Query with our code

I have already written code for this. No explanation needed, but you can see some of the examples of GQL query to get an idea of that: [https://graphql.org/learn/queries/](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

This is my code(might be difficult to understand so feel free to skip it): [https://github.com/rahul-lohra/gql-formatter-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rahul/gqlformat/parser/NodeCreator.kt](https://github.com/rahul-lohra/gql-formatter-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rahul/gqlformat/parser/NodeCreator.kt)

Let’s just say we have an API to get formatted GQL Query:

    val nodeCreator = NodeCreator()
    val node = nodeCreator.createNode(unformatted text)
    val nodeText = nodeCreator.prettyPrint2(node, offset)

The nodeText will return the formatted GQL query

Now we need some logic(or API) to get variable’s value which is in our kotlin file. You can say we have to parse our code and extract the necessary information. To do this we have to understand a new concept **PSI** (It’s super easy don’t worry)
&gt; **PSI** : Program Structure Interface : Its responsible for** parsing** your file and getting **meaningful data** from it. Like it you can directly go to any comments, or variables or any functions. (link: [https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/architectural_overview/psi.html](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/architectural_overview/psi.html))

**PsiElements**: A file is represented as ***tress of PsiElements***. (link: [https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/architectural_overview/psi_elements.html](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/architectural_overview/psi_elements.html)). It is very similar to the Tree data structure where you have many nodes connected to each other and every node might have some special property. Eg one of them can be a function or a comment or a class name or a string value or import statements

To visually see how it looks you can do this
**1. Navigate to any file**
**2. Tools -&gt; View PSI Structure of Current file**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2304/1*s1BK_z7N-AZxvuCWiugeAA.png)

Now we need a way to ***navigate*** through this PSI elements and find our variable where the String is stored

We will use ***KtTreeVisitorVoid*** from package org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi It will help to navigate through ***Kotlin’s PSI Element. ***If you want to parse a Java file then you can use ***JavaRecursiveElementVisitor***
&gt; To use ***KtTreeVisitorVoid ***we have to add its dependency. 1 thing to note is we need to add dependency on plugin.xml but **not on** build.gradle, like this:

    <idea-plugin>
    ....
        <depends>org.jetbrains.kotlin</depends>

        <extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.intellij">
             <toolWindow id="Gql Format" anchor="right" factoryClass="com.rahul.gqlformat.MyToolWindow">
             </toolWindow>
        </extensions>
    ....

    </idea-plugin>

Here is the documentation of plugin dependencies: [https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/plugin_compatibility.html#declaring-plugin-dependencies](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/plugin_compatibility.html#declaring-plugin-dependencies)

### Add logic to parse the file

We will create a class named EditorLogic.kt : it is responsible for
1. Get **currently opened** file
2. **Traversing** the code 
3. **Extract** the value assigned in variable 
4. **Pass** that value to our NodeCreater (it will reformat the GQL)
5. **Paste** the formatted value into the ToolWindow
6. **Replace** the original value with our formatted value from ToolWindow

1. Currently opened file: will use FileEditorManager to get current PsiFile

1. Code Traversal: we will use KtTreeVisitorVoid

1. Value Extraction: override visitProperty(property:KtPropery)

1. Passing value does not require any explanation

1. Pasting value to our Toolwindow: we will do this : textArea.text=”our formatted text”

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/705ad3d1e41cf63e35e4fb04c997673c" frameborder="0"></iframe>

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rzOxZOE-1SnVITj94iRpbg.png)

This might be useful to understand the code flow from our input till we paste the formatted code to our tool window

Explanation of keywords:
1. KtBinaryExpression
2. KtStringTemplateExpression
3. KtDotQualifiedExpression
Our intention is to ***extract the assigned value***(String) from the variable. But the assigned value can be of above different types(there can be more)
Here are the examples for the above elements

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2074/1*oY5q1LPGbbZBDvaHk2JllQ.png)

Now we need to see how we are ***passing the variable name***. It’s a simple click event added on the button Import of our ToolWindow

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2xCdx0Tp7DXwgc10HxcWvg.png)

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/baa1a2bdc530e1e25ca2099999ceac04" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Cool We should be able to at least see the formatted GQL query in our tool window

## 4. Paste the formatted GQL query back to our file

Things to do:
**1.Replace existing PsiElement with formatted String:** Means we have to *create a new PsiElement* and will need to store formatted String into it and then need to replace it with the original PsiElement which has an unformatted query
**2. Use proper *indent* **(optional)
**3. Handle *dollar sign***: because Kotlin treats dollar sign in a different way, for eg it can be used as a placeholder and much more

### Replacing PsiElement

API to replace PsiElement is very simple:

    PsiElement.resplace(newPsiElement)

And we just need to wrap this inside another block else we will get exceptions:

    WriteCommandAction.runWriteCommandAction(*project*) **{
        **oldPsiElemet.replace(newPsiElement)
    **}**

This is how we are creating newPsiElement

    val newPsiElement = KtPsiFactory(psiElement.*project*).createStringTemplate(text)

### Use proper indent

We need to know where should we start our string. In the below figure we need to know how ***FAR*** ***the variable is from the left***

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*DAKnio9FLahO5SKQsWN4KQ.png)

We have an api for this: it will tell give us the column no(start point) of the variable

    val editor = FileEditorManager.getInstance(psiElement.*project*).*selectedTextEditor
    *val variableCol = (editor as EditorImpl).offsetToLogicalPosition(psiElement.*parent*.*textOffset*).column

Here the PsiElemt refers to the String value, that’s why we have taken psiElement.parent

### Dollar Sign

1. As of now, we are changing $ to ${“$”}

1. ${“$”} will be ignored

We have used regular expression for this, the code might look difficult, but it's very easy, just go through it doesn’t require any explanation

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/85ffc2ee78633750b6d553973afb737b" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Cool.. we have covered all the logics. In short, this is what we did:

## 5. Few things about publishing plugin

This is very straight forward and easy and there are multiple ways to upload.

From Gradle: [https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/build_system/deployment.html](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/build_system/deployment.html)

I am showing you the simplest one. 
You can follow this guide: [https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/publishing_plugin.html](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/publishing_plugin.html)
It is basically
1. Login to JetBrains account
2. Choose upload plugin
3. A form will be displayed and it will ask for jar/zip
You can run this command from your root project to get the jar/zip

    ./gradlew buildPlugin

This will create a zip or jar in **build/distributions/plugin-name.jar**

You can upload this file on their site

After uploading the plugin, kindly fill as much information about your plugin as you can. 
Like: How to use, what things are supported, put screenshots, video links else the reviewer will tell these things to you
