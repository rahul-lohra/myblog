<p>Key components</p>

<p><strong>Ble</strong> - Bluetooth Low energy device</p>

<p><strong>GATT</strong> - Defines protocol(set of rules) on how data should be exchanged</p>

<p><strong>GATT Server</strong> - Provides functionality to create <strong>Services</strong> and broadcast itself so other <strong>Gatt Client</strong> can connect to it. (can be slightly confusing, I know but don’t worry, this will be cleared later). Treat it as a web server.</p>

<p><strong>Gatt Client</strong> - It is responsible for scanning nearby <strong>GATT Server</strong>, connecting to it and exchanging data(in terms of <strong>Characteristics</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Service</strong> - A service is a collection of characteristics. For example, you could have a service called “Heart Rate Monitor” that includes characteristics such as “heart rate measurement.”</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics</strong> - It contains a value and a list of <strong>descriptors</strong></p>

<p><strong>Descriptors</strong> - It contains a value and generally it is used as attributes of a <strong>Characteristics</strong></p>

<p><strong>UUID</strong> - Just a unique identifier, on how to uniquely identify/create a Service or a characteristics or a descriptor.</p>

<p>For exchanging data over http network, we need two devices one will act as a server and another will act as client. Eg - that’s how website work</p>

<p>This same thing applies in Ble network, we need two devices one will act as a <strong>Gatt server</strong> and another will act as <strong>Gatt client</strong> for exchanging of data.</p>

<p>And a device can be both Gatt Server and Gatt client.</p>

<p>There are still some concepts left, I will teach them when they are used.</p>

<p>For Android chat application, we will have two devices and they both will act as a Gatt Server and Gatt Client.</p>
